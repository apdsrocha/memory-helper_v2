# Memory Helper

> A super tiny project to help me practice React and Redux

Basically this is an attempt at making a more evolved version of this [first attempt](https://silly-borg-178afb.netlify.app/) - the github repository for that first project can be found [here](https://github.com/apdsrocha/memory-helper). It's still a little web app that lets you record memory snippets and have them associated with a city of your chosing, bringing in the current weather and date of entry. It should look nifty on cell phones, but I haven't worked on a desktop version yet.

## Installing / Getting started

You should be able to browse it locally after downloading the project, and then running `npm install` followed by `npm start`. The project should open on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), enabling view it in the browser. You can also checkout the deployed version, I've set it up [ here. ](https://eager-sinoussi-83fbc9.netlify.app/)

## Developing

### Built With

This was built with React (throught create-react-app) and makes use of Redux for state management.

## Api Reference

I used the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
